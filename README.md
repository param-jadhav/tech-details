‚ùó HikariCP CANNOT enforce query execution timeout.

It‚Äôs a connection pool, not a query watchdog. Let's break it down properly:

‚úÖ What HikariCP CAN Do (Effectively)

Property	Purpose
connectionTimeout	Time to wait for a connection from the pool before throwing error.
idleTimeout	Closes idle connections after this time.
maxLifetime	Maximum lifespan of a connection.
validationTimeout	Timeout for testing if a connection is alive.
Example from your application.yml:

yaml
Copy
Edit
spring.datasource.hikari:
  connection-timeout: 30000 # 30 seconds
  maximum-pool-size: 10
  idle-timeout: 600000
  max-lifetime: 1800000
‚ùå What HikariCP Cannot Do
It does not kill slow or long-running SQL queries.

It does not enforce a timeout on actual DB query execution.

So even if connectionTimeout = 500ms, this just means:

‚ùùIf no connection is available in 500ms, throw an error.‚ùû
NOT:
‚ùùIf a query takes more than 500ms, cancel it.‚ùû

‚úÖ Why This Confuses People
Because connectionTimeout sounds like it might apply to query execution ‚Äî but it only applies to pool access.

Your query might wait for a connection for x milliseconds, but once it gets one, HikariCP steps out ‚Äî the rest is up to:

JDBC Driver (MySQL)

Hibernate / JPA

Your code

üîç So What‚Äôs the Right Way to Set Query Timeout with Hikari?
Hikari doesn‚Äôt handle it directly, but if you‚Äôre very determined, you can:

Use a custom DataSource wrapper that wraps the connection/statement and sets timeout manually.

Set maxExecutionTime or socketTimeout in the JDBC URL (but you already mentioned that‚Äôs not ideal for you).

Or best: wrap your repository calls in a Future.get(timeout), which works with any datasource.

‚úÖ Recommended Hybrid Approach with Hikari
Use Hikari for connection pooling (as it‚Äôs the best pool out there), but combine it with:

Future.get(timeout) to cut slow queries

Optional: log slow queries using a proxy datasource (like p6spy)

Retry logic via Spring Retry or Resilience4j

TL;DR ‚Äî HikariCP

Feature	Can HikariCP Do It?
Pool connections efficiently	‚úÖ Yes
Set query timeout	‚ùå No
Cancel slow queries	‚ùå No
Control connection lifetime	‚úÖ Yes
Throw timeout if pool is empty	‚úÖ Yes (connectionTimeout)
Let me know if you'd like to see a utility wrapper to auto-timeout JPA calls without messing with JDBC or native queries. I can generate that for you.


@Repository
public interface ApplicationLookupRepository extends JpaRepository<ApplicationLookupBean, Long> {

    @Query(
        value = "/*+ MAX_EXECUTION_TIME(30000) */ " +  // 30-second timeout enforced by MySQL
                "SELECT * FROM application_lookup " +   // Replace with your actual table name
                "WHERE key_code = :keyCode " +
                "AND merchant_number = :merchantNumber " +
                "AND client_id = :clientId " +
                "ORDER BY timestamp DESC",
        nativeQuery = true
    )
    List<ApplicationLookupBean> findByKeyCodeAndMerchantNumberAndClientIdOrderByTimestampDesc(
        @Param("keyCode") String keyCode,
        @Param("merchantNumber") String merchantNumber,
        @Param("clientId") String clientId
    );
}
